## Ride Share App
A possible extension of this project is a ride share app. Vehicle telemetry data can be streamed using IoT hub and processed using event hubs, stream analytics, data lake gen2, data factory, azure synapse or databricks. An app to track vehicle location and interact with users can be created using Azure Mobile Apps (Backend) and Flutter or React.js (Frontend).
